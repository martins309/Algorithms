Write a program that returns all prime numbers up to a given max.
Prime number: A number greater than 1 that is only divisible by itself and 1


We need to define the max number 
 iterate through the list to see first if the number is divisible by any number 
 less than itself

we need an array to put the prime numbers in






Group 2:
3. Write a function to reverse a string (provided as an argument)
4. Write a function to return a boolean based on whether or not the argument provided (string) is a palindrome. A palindrome is word or phrase that has the same characters whether forward or backwards
eg racecar => true; truck => false

Needs: a fucntion that takes the string and reverses it, iterate through the string(loop),  methods (.pop() or .push()) to pop that last letter and push it an empty string





1. Write a function that multiplies two numbers (provided as arguments) without using *
2. Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of “islands of 1s” (e.g. groups of 1s)
eg [0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1] => 7


Needs 1: function that takes two arguments (number1 and number 2), use a for loop to add number1 n times, where the letter n = number2


Needs 2: an array of 1s and 0s, we need to count how many times there is a group of ones grouped together, return an answer , john says we need counter lol, and 2 for loop



// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
// You can return the answer in any order.
// Givens 
// - Only one valid answer exists 
// - nums will always be Array, and target will always be number 
// - 2 <= nums.length <= 1,000
// - -1,000,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 1,000,000,000 
// - -1,000,000,000 <= target <= 1,000,000,000 
// Examples
// Ex input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Ex output: [0,1]
// Ex input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
// Ex output: [1,2]
// Ex input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
// Ex output: [0,1]

Needs 1: we need 2 loops to iterate through the array, we need to have a return statement that only returns the indices
